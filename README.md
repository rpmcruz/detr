# detr
A simple implementation of [DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872) (End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers) for educational and practical purposes.

The implementation seems pretty faithful to the paper and it seems to produce results in the right direction. One difference is that I use much smaller images. However, I was not able to fully evaluate it since it takes quite a bit (12 minutes per epoch on my machine).
